I couldn't get openscad to do a final (f6) render of this STL. I tried various methods to close up the gaps to make it a solid model, but I coulnd't seem to get it to work. I opened the model in max, and there were numerous errors and holes and whatnot, and I decided that it might be easier just to get a new scan and try again with that. What's in this repository is where I got to with the crappy scan, and a screenshot of the result.
